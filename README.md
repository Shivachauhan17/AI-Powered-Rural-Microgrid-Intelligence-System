# AI-Powered-Rural-Microgrid-Intelligence-System
AI-powered Rural Microgrid Intelligence System that predicts household electricity demand and solar generation, then optimally allocates energy using fairness and priority constraints. Combines ML forecasting (XGBoost/LSTM) with optimization (OR-Tools) to reduce blackouts, improve battery life, and ensure equitable energy distribution.
